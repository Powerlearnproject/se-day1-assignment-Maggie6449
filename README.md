Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering- is the systematic applicatin of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintainance of high quality software systems.
importance--it enables creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects in modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline
the advent of structured programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements--gathering and documenting user needs and system requirement.
Design--creating high-level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
implemantation--writing code and bulding the software according to the design specification.
Testing--conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment--realising the softwarre to users or customers.
Maintaince-- providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall provides sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards while Agile is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
Agile can be used in any large scale project in any industry while Waterfall  works best for those proect that are replicable and proven.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer-- responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality assurance Engineer--ensures software quality by designing and executing tests plans.
Project manager--oversees  the planning, execution and delivery of software projjects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs--software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing,debuggingand testing code e.g visual studio
VCS-- software tools for tracting changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git, subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challanges;
changing requirement-requirement may change during development cycle leading to scope creep and projects deklays.
tight deadlines--pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and comprised quality.
technical debts
strategies  to overcome;
effective communication
agile methologies
priortization of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit--testing individual components or modules of software
intergration-- testing interaction between different components 
system--testing the entire software systems as a whole.
acceptance-- testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering--is all about crafting questions or statement to get the best possible responses from AI medels.
importance--it enhances user experience, making interaction with technology more efficient,intuitive and accessible.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example;if you ask"what cows are best to keep" instead ask "what milk cows are best to keep"
improved prompt is more effective since it gives  more relevant resuits.
